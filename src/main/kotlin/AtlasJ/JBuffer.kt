        /* Bytebuffer, What is:
         The biggest problem in understanding ByteBuffer is presuming that it is cleverer than it really is.
         ByteBuffer is a baffling class.
          It is a bit like a RAM-based RandomAccessFile.
          It is also a bit like a ByteArrayList without the auto_grow feature, to let you deal with partly filled byte[] in a consistent way.
         It looks at first as if it might be a traditional circular squirrel cage buffer but it is not.
         There is no circularity.
         Nor is it some kind of virtual moving window on a file.
         It is not like a pipe, designed to simulate a giant stream with a finite buffer.
         There is no queuing of any kind.
         It is not even as clever as COBOL double buffering, which you might suspect by it having a flip method.
         It has no asynchronous look-ahead.
         It is extremely low level. nio should probably have been call LLIO (low level io).
         You must explicitly clear and fill the buffer and explicitly read/or write it.
          It is up to you to avoid overfilling the buffer.
         It is a very mundane buffer. The only thing that makes it much different from a raw byte[] is the way may be backed
         something that only looks like a byte[] but is not really, e.g. An entire memory mapped file or direct I/O buffer contain
        part of a file.*/
        /**
        [How_It_Works]
        You would expect ByteBuffer to have a length() method, it does not. Instead it has a several length-like concepts:
        mark <= position <= limit <= capacity.
        Just what do these term mean in English? Working right to left:
