## Theory: Debugging techniques

Debugging is the process of finding and fixing bugs in a program. Some bugs, like those that prevent the program from compiling, can be fixed easily since the compiler or an IDE can tell you what's wrong. Other bugs are trickier and may require you to put a lot of effort into detecting them.

In this topic, we will consider the most popular ways that programmers use to debug a program:

- Logging
- Assertions
- Attaching a debugger

##### Logging/'println' debugging

One way to track the changes in the program state is to insert additional print statements in the code. When executed, they will inform you about what's happening under the hood at runtime.

For example, you can insert a line just before a method returns that will print the return value to the console. This way, in addition to seeing the final result, you will also be able to understand what happens at a certain stage of data processing.

Let's look at the following code snippet, which hangs indefinitely when run:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    count(1, 10)
}

fun count(start: Int, to: Int) {
    var start = start
    while (start < to); {
        println(start)
        start++
    }
}
```

While the error is not hard to catch, we can still add some print statements that would clearly indicate where the hanging happens:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    println("main() started")
    count(1, 10)
    println("main() complete")
}

fun count(start: Int, to: Int) {
    println("count() started")
    var start = start
    while (start < to); {
        println(start)
        start++
    }
    println("count() complete")
}
```

Now, instead of just hanging, the program will output:

```kotlin
main() started
count() started
```

This output shows us that the program reaches the start of the `count()` method, but never reaches its end, which means that the problem is in the `while` loop. After we take a closer look at the construct, we see that there is an extra semicolon, and the loop 'body' is actually an unused lambda expression.

Inserting print statements is the most basic way to debug your code, however, we provide it just so you know this technique. You should not use this method in real projects because modern debuggers can do the same in a much more convenient way and because you would not be able to do that everywhere. For example, if you want to get information from some library code, this would be a problem because you cannot modify compiled code.

Be patient, we will cover the nice way shortly.

##### Assertions

In order to detect bugs in the program at earlier development stages, you can use assertions. The assertion is a mechanism that monitors the program state, but unlike additional print statements, it terminates the program in a fail-fast manner when things go wrong.

Fail-fast is an approach when errors that could otherwise be non-fatal are forced to cause an immediate failure, thus making them visible.

You may wonder why one would want to crash the production code. That's because failing immediately is much more safer than doing the wrong thing.

Letâ€™s take a look at the following program:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val casper = Cat("Casper", -1)
}

class Cat(val name: String, val age: Int)
```

This code creates a `Cat` object. This would be fine if it weren't for the negative age value that makes no sense. Naturally, in a more complex program, this may lead to various bugs. Such an object may be passed around for a long time before we see a problem, and when a problem arises, it is not always obvious what was the cause.

To prevent that from happening, we can check 'age' parameter to be positive and 'name' is non-empty:

```kotlin
class Cat(val name: String, val age: Int) {
    init {
        require(age >= 0) { "Invalid age: $age" }          // IllegalArgumentException 
        check(name.isNotEmpty()) { "Invalid name: $name" } // IllegalStateException 
    }
}
```

The first parameter is the boolean expression that should be checked, and when it evaluates to `false`, any exception is thrown. The second parameter is a function which generates a message that describes this error. You should use `require` when you are validating the argument passed to the function and `check` when you are checking the state of the object, as in this case.

Now, if we run the code, the program will throw an error and terminate right in the `Cat` constructor:

```kotlin
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid age: -1
  at Cat.<init>(brokenInvariants.kt:7)
  at BrokenInvariantsKt.main(brokenInvariants.kt:3)
```

You may have noticed that we used the word *invariants* and are curious what it means. **Invariants** are constraints that must be met for a program to function properly. In the code above, positive `age` is an example of an invariant. Using a negative `age` is asking for a problem. Enforcing invariants is exactly why we need assertions.

We can also use assertions to check method preconditions and postconditions, that is conditions that must be met before or after a method is invoked.

##### Attaching a debugger

A debugger is a tool that interferes with the normal program execution allowing you to get runtime information and test different scenarios to diagnose bugs. This is the most popular use of debuggers. However, when you grow more experienced with them, you'll see that they can be helpful in various situations, not necessarily related to bugs.

Modern debuggers provide a vast variety of tools that can be used to diagnose the most intricate failure conditions, so they definitely warrant a section of their own. In the next topics, we will get started with IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio debugger and learn how to debug simple code.

##### Conclusion

In this topic, you have learned about different debugging techniques you can use to ensure that your code is error-free. The most basic method is inserting print statements to keep track of the values and the execution order of your program. Also, you may add assertions using `require` and `check` functions to make potential hidden errors visible at an early stage of development. Finally, you may attach a debugger to the program to examine its internal state at runtime. These techniques will help you to detect and fix bugs in your code efficiently.
